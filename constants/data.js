      `I've been making Web Applications since I was 13 or 14 years old. I found the joy of doing that from an HTML school project. From that my curiosity grew larger and started small projects of my own which lead to my first client at school.`,
      `Fast forward 10 years, I graduated college landed my first IT job as a Technical Consultant. I learned a lot of things including PL/SQL, Oracle financials, Oracle Reports and so many other cool things may it be from technical or organizational perspective.`,
      `But now I feel great. I've been coding in React, Node.js, Expressjs, Postgres, Oracle PL/SQL, Python, Django to name a few.`,,
